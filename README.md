# Fetch SRE Monitoring Tool

## üß≠ Overview

This project provides two scripts for monitoring HTTP endpoint health:

1. **Console-based Monitor (`monitor.py`)**  
   - Logs availability % and latency per domain to the terminal.
2. **Prometheus + Grafana Monitor (`monitor_grafana.py`)**  
   - Pushes metrics to Prometheus via Pushgateway and visualizes them in Grafana.

Both scripts use a YAML configuration file and run health checks every 15 seconds.
